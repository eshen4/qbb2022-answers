Overall this looks good. You plotting code looks good and your plots look correct. While not required, it is nice if you include the commands you ran on the command line to do these data manipulations. Think of it as showing your work. As for the legend on the superpopulation plot, that gave lots of people difficulty, but you did a good job with it. All in all, well done. Keep it up!
