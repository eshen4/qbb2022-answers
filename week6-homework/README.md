# Quant Bio Week 6 Homework: The 3D Genome

###Part 1:

What percentage of reads are valid interactions (duplicates do not count as valid)?
- dCTCF valid interaction pairs: 37.8%
- ddCTCF valid interaction pairs: 36.6%
What constitutes the majority of invalid 3C pairs? What does it actually mean (you may need to dig into the HiC-Pro manual)?
- The invalid 3C pairs are mainly invalid ligation products; these include but are not limited to dangling ends, self circles, religations, etc. These are essentially products during the mapping aspect of the assay experienced poor ligation in a way that makes their reads invalid.

###Part 2:

1. I don't see the highlighted region in our figures (the differential map) compared to the paper's (figure 4a).
2. There's a slight difference in amount of interaction (higher interaction in the fully sequenced inputs).
3. The highlighted signal in figure 4a indicates a potential interaction that is not shown in our generated plots.
