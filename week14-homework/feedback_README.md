This is a good start, Emily! A few comments and things we need for completion:
1. For question 2, I don't think these approaches are the best. The names of the nodes(contigs) aren't informative as to identity of the contig. Additionally, the length of the contig is also not necessarily informative. Most species probably have a distribution of contig lengths. Things like sequence identity, GC content might be better metrics (no points deducted)
2. For question 3B, I need some sort of code or explanation of how you got this answer (especially as I'm not sure I agree) (-1 point)
3. For question 3C, again, I need some sort of code or explanation about how you got this answer. We want to look at the total length of contigs in each bin (-1 point)
4. Still missing your code and answer for Step 3/Question 4 (-1.5 points)

Nice work so far!
