This is almost perfect! Just one small issue:

1. When you're plotting your manhattan plot, you actually want to use the `.assoc.linear` files rather than the `.qassoc` files. The `.qassoc` files are actually the output of including the `--assoc` flag in your `plink` command. I believe this does something called a Wald test, when we want to just do simple linear regression (with `--linear`) (no points deducted)

Other than that very small issue, the rest of your assignment looks awesome. Very well done!
