Great work on this! One minor thing: your post filtering PCA plot looks a little bit funky, and the genes that you're finding from `rank_genes_groups` look a little funky as well. I'm quite honestly not entirely sure what went wrong, but the rest of your code looks correct and the plots look great (minor the weird groupings), so I'm gonna say don't worry about it! Nice work.
